To evaluate the so-called creative personality tuning, Urbanâ€™s figural test of creative thinking was used. Creativity in this test is represented by numerous aspects (cognitive parts are represented by divergent thinking and general and specific knowledge; personality parts are represented by the focus on a goal, motivation and openness to respecting ambiguity).

The result of the test is in the range of the average (middle 50%, 26/75<sup>th</sup> percentile).
