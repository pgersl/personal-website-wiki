# Introduction
[Judeo-Christian values](https://dennisprager.com/column/what-are-judeo-christian-values/) are the basis of my value system. I am a Christian and I believe in God. Hence, my values are mainly derived from my religion. However, not all my thinking is solely based on my religion. My values that are not based on religion are mainly political and economic.
# Religion
I am a catholic and I try to lead a Christian life. I was born into a catholic family, however, I never really got into the religion as a child. It is only close to adulthood that I started to understand the reasons why there even is a religion and why catholicism is the best option.

I got back to church mainly because I realized one thing: *answers to the questions of morality cannot be derived from scientific discovery or using nothing but reason*. Religion is the final piece of the puzzle for me, it helps me navigate the world. Thanks to it, I at least have the slightest idea of what being good means, why are things beautiful, how to overcome evil, and much more.

I think that there indeed is one moral truth, there indeed is one good and one evil same for everything, I do not think that beauty is subjective, and I do think that the Ten Commandments are the core of one's morality.
# Politics, economics
My political views lean toward the right side of the political aisle. I am a conservative in policy, however, I am very progressive in the development and adaptation of new technology. I also see some positive aspects of social states, like the one I live in, where there is free healthcare and education. I also think that the efforts to conserve the environment are good and with enough time, they will be better than the solutions for transport/electricity generation/waste disposal and others that we currently have.

In terms of economics, I am a fan of capitalism. I see how this system results in the fastest development of new technology that betters the world. I think that gathering wealth in ways that are just by the law of the state and the law of God.
